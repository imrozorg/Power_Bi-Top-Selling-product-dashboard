📊 Welcome to the Sales Dashboard project! 🚀

In this project, I'm diving into sales data to uncover some cool insights. 📈

**What it does:**
This dashboard helps figure out which products are selling the most and where. 🛒 Lots of different numbers help with that!

**How it works:**
1. **Connecting the Data:** I bring in all the data from databases using SQL and Excel. 🗃️
2. **Checking the Data:** I look closely at the tables and databases to understand what's going on. 🔍
3. **Cleaning up the Data:** I use fancy tools called DAX to make sure the data is nice and clean. 🧹
4. **Building the Model:** I create a special model to organize the data and make it easier to understand. 🏗️
5. **Creating the Dashboard:** This is the fun part! I make a super cool dashboard with colorful charts and graphs to show off the findings. 🎨

**What I found:**
1. 🚚 Delivery Time: Noticed that the time for deliveries has been getting faster over the years. 📦
2. 💰 Sales Boost: Sales have gone up by a whopping 20%! 📈
3. 🏆 Profitable Product: Turns out, Canon images are the big money-makers! 📸💰
4. ⚠️ Returns: Also seen that return orders are only about 2% of the sales each year. 🔄

**What I suggest:**
1. 🎯 Focus on Top Customers: To make even more money, it's a good idea to give special discounts to the top 10-15 customers. 🤑

So there you have it! The Sales Dashboard is helping me make smarter decisions and find new ways to grow the business. 🌟
